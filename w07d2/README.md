### Hooks
- Hooks should be called at the top level of our component
- You can't call Hooks inside a conditional statement or loops, inside any function


### Data

Props => data
- Used to pass data from the parent to the child
- Can not update props from the child component
- A change triggers re-render


State => data
- Used to manage data locally in the component
- Use setter function to update the state
- A change triggers re-render
